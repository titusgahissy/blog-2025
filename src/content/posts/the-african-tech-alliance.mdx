A few months ago, I started working on a new project for the African Caucus 2025.

Now, I’ll admit, I had to do a quick Google search (don’t judge me) to brush up on my knowledge of the African Caucus. But what I found was interesting and it got my mind spinning in directions I never expected.

So, let’s take a little journey together. I promise, no passport required.

## What on Earth is the African Caucus?

Let’s start with the basics. The African Caucus isn’t a secret society (though that would be cool). It’s a joint platform created way back in 1963—when bell-bottoms were cool and the Beatles were just getting started. The Caucus brings together all the African Governors of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group (WBG). These two are sometimes called the Bretton Woods institutions, which sounds fancy, but basically means they’re the big bosses of global finance.

Every year, the presidency of the African Caucus rotates like a well-oiled relay race baton. The group meets twice a year: once in the country holding the presidency, and then again wherever the IMF and World Bank are having their annual shindig. The first meeting is all about strategy—defining policies, brainstorming solutions, and tackling the big challenges facing Africa. They wrap it all up in a Memorandum and hand it over to the IMF and WBG at the second meeting, with a polite but firm, “Here’s what Africa needs, thank you very much.”

The goal? To make sure Africa’s voice is heard loud and clear in the halls of global power. To influence decisions, programs, and support that will help the continent develop, transform, and—dare I say—thrive.

## The Digitalization Dilemma

Now, here’s where things get interesting. As I started working on the project, a thought kept nagging at me. I’m not usually one for utopian daydreams (I prefer my feet planted firmly on the ground, thank you), but this idea just wouldn’t let go.

You see, across Africa, governments are all going through—or will soon go through—the process of digitalization. That’s a fancy way of saying, “Let’s use technology to make things work better.” Sounds simple, right? But here’s the catch: every country is trying to buy or build its own solutions to reach its goals.

Picture this: 54 African countries (plus Haiti, who’s hanging out as an observer) are all members of the African Caucus. Each one is out there, hustling to find the best digital tools, software, and systems. Some are buying off-the-shelf products, others are building from scratch, and a few are probably still doing things manually (no judgment).

It’s like everyone is trying to bake the same cake, but each country is shopping at a different grocery store, using different recipes, and sometimes, accidentally buying salt instead of sugar.

## Enter: The African Tech Alliance - TATA :)

And then it hit me. What if we flipped the script?

Imagine this: each country selects a few bright tech wizards (let's say 3+) and problem-solvers to form a “dream team.” That’s more than 162 people (math checks out, I promise) with one mission: to choose or build all the digital solutions African governments need.

But here’s the twist: instead of reinventing the wheel 54 times, this team would focus on creating a digital backbone that’s 80-90% the same for everyone. The remaining 10-20%? That’s where each country can add its own special sauce—tailoring the system to fit local needs, languages, and quirks.

And to make sure this isn’t just another committee with big ideas and no budget, we give them a stellar pool of resources—shared by all countries. No more duplicating efforts. Just one big, beautiful, collaborative effort.

The result? Absolute beauty. A continent-wide digital infrastructure that’s robust, efficient, and uniquely African

## Why Aren’t We Doing This Already?

If this idea sounds so good, why isn’t it already a reality? Why aren’t 162+ brilliant minds across Africa already huddled together, building the ultimate digital backbone? Well, let’s put on our detective hats and ask a few questions that might explain the holdup.

### Who gets to be on the dream team?

With 54 countries in the mix, picking just a few representatives from each is no small feat. How do you ensure everyone’s voice is heard? Where do you pick the best coders, architects, project managers or the most passionate problem-solvers? And who decides what “best” even means? Let’s be honest, we all know how much fun group projects can be…

### Can we agree on what we actually need?

Each country has its own unique challenges, priorities, and, let’s face it, quirks. What works for Namibia might not work for Nigeria. Can we really find that magical 80-90% backbone that fits everyone, or will we end up with a digital Frankenstein’s monster—partly genius, partly chaos?

### Who’s holding the purse strings?

Pooling resources sounds great, but who manages the budget? Who decides how much each country contributes, and how the money gets spent? If you’ve ever tried to split a restaurant bill with a big group, you know this can get complicated fast.

### What about trust?

Let’s be real: trust doesn’t always come easy. Will countries be willing to share their data and strategies? Or will old and current rivalries and suspicions get in the way of real collaboration?

### Is there political will?

Big, bold ideas need champions—leaders who are willing to take risks, try new things, and sometimes, ruffle a few feathers. Do we have enough of those leaders ready to push for this kind of radical teamwork?

### And finally… do we believe it’s possible?

Sometimes, the biggest barrier is simply believing that something this ambitious can actually work. It’s easy to get stuck in the “that’s just the way things are” mindset. But what if we asked, “Why not?” instead?

So yes, there are plenty of hurdles—some big, some small, some just plain weird. But every great idea starts with a question. And maybe, just maybe, the answers will surprise us.

## The Power of Collaboration

Let’s take a moment to dream. (Don’t worry, I won’t get too sappy.)

What if, instead of competing, we collaborated? What if we pooled our resources, shared our best ideas, and built something bigger than any one country could achieve alone?

Think about it: a shared digital backbone would mean faster progress, lower costs, and fewer headaches. It would mean governments could focus on what really matters—serving their people—instead of troubleshooting software bugs or negotiating with vendors.

It would also mean that no country gets left behind. The smallest nations would have access to the same cutting-edge tools as the biggest players. The digital divide? More like a digital bridge.

## Lessons from the Real World

This isn’t just a pipe dream. There are real-world examples of this kind of collaboration working wonders.

Take Estonia, for example. This tiny country in Northern Europe went all-in on digital government, creating a system that’s now the envy of the world. They didn’t do it by going it alone—they partnered with neighbors, shared their code, and invited others to learn from their experience.

Or look at the African Union’s efforts to create a single digital market. It’s a big, bold vision—and it’s already starting to bear fruit.

The point is: when we work together, we can achieve things that once seemed impossible.

## Final Thoughts: Dare to Dream

I know, I know. It’s easy to get cynical. The world is full of big ideas that never quite get off the ground. But sometimes, all it takes is one spark to light a fire.

So here’s my challenge to you (and to myself): let’s dare to dream. Let’s imagine a future where Africa leads the way in digital innovation—not by competing, but by collaborating.

Who knows? Maybe, just maybe, the next big thing will come from a team of 100+ dreamers, working together to build something beautiful.

And if you’re reading this and thinking, “Hey, I want in!”—well, you know where to find me.
