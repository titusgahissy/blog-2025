After years of working closely with teams and founders, I inevitably found myself covering the same core topics quite often before we could dive into the specifics.

Many have asked if there was a way to continue learning after our workshops ended. Though I never quite found the time to create that resource â€“ until now. I'm finally giving this project the attention it deserves, creating a knowledge base that extends beyond our sessions together.
