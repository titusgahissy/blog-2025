This one is very special and personal. 
The word IKOUĒ means "together" in my native language.
I had this project in mind for a long time, and I finally decided to make it happen in 2024.

This non profit organization's goal is to create better conditions for the Diaspora to support the 
education, innovation and growth of the country.
