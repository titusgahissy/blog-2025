Louma is a traditional term used among nomadic communities from Central to West Africa. It translates to "marketplace" or "place of trade," reflecting the project's essence.

The mission of Louma is to drive widespread adoption of digital solutions that create meaningful economic opportunities. We're building bridges between traditional commerce and modern financial technologies to empower underserved communities.
